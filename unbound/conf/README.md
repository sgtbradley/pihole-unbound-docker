## forward-records.conf

Set your upstream DNS servers here. You can add whichever DNS servers you please if they are not featured in this list, however you will need to rebuild

## a-records.conf & srv-records.conf

You should set these in pi-hole instead, but if that does not work then feel free to also set them here.
